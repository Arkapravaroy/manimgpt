# manimgpt
This repo contains code which closely follow the implementation of GPT 2 as explained by Sebastian Raschka in his book.
Using a dataset of example scenes and corresponding manim code (hope that the code is correct!) an effort is made to build a model that can generate manim and python code to visualize simple scenes. Thus the name manimgpt.

In my local setup result was almost garbage.
Therefore used gpu of google colab to increase dataset size and model complexity and training for more epochs.
Result is still not satisfactory but showing initial promise
Pushing the code fiels and colab notebook.

## ToDo:
1. Make the code better and work properly
2. Further extend it to make a complete agentic system later
3. Create an userinterface
4. Modify the architecture to achieve better results
